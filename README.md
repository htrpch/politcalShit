# Social Media Activity as Proxy for opinion


Herein we study the problem of forecasting political outcomes based on politicians' social media activity analysis. We build up our data sets by scraping twitter posts of Brazilian congressmen in the period 2019-2021. We also explore some results obtained by the use of sentiment analysis over the same data.
We model the system using Markov Chains and explore its properties to obtain expectation values and probabilities.
